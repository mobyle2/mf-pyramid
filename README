This is a new development, mainly for own training, and not for use yet.

admin provides annotations on a Ming object (@admin) to analyse objects and create actions and forms on objects automatically.

Goal is to generate an admin dashboard for each object (show/edit/delete per object and list of objects)

renderer is in charge of generating HTML per attribute type.

more customization will also be available to force type of the attribute (Checkbox etc...)

Pyramid routes and templates will be set automatically
