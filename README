This is a new development, mainly for own training, and not for use yet.

admin provides annotations on a Ming object (@admin) to analyse objects and create actions and forms on objects automatically.

Goal is to generate an admin dashboard for each object (show/edit/delete per object and list of objects)

renderer is in charge of generating HTML per attribute type.

more customization will also be available to force type of the attribute (Checkbox etc...)

Pyramid routes and templates will be set automatically

TODO:
 add routes
 add views
 add templates
 renderers: date, time, list


LICENSE: LGPL

USAGE:

add mf_decorator above your Ming classes

For dashboard, to add User and Group, insert in Pyramid init :

Dashboard.add_dashboard([User,Group],config)

Warning: this should be added after your routes declaration because it insertts generic routes to match objets:

/Users/
/Users/id
/Groups/
/Groups/ida
...
